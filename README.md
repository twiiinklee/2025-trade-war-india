## 📌 Abstract

The resurgence of the US-China trade war in 2025 marks a decisive shift in the global economic order. Unlike the tariff-focused dispute of 2018, the renewed conflict spans technology decoupling, supply chain fragmentation, and strategic realignments across multilateral frameworks. These developments have created both vulnerabilities and opportunities for developing economies-particularly India. This paper examines India's strategic and policy response to the 2025 conflict, contrasting it with its reactive stance in 2018. It finds that India has adopted a more mature, globally integrated trade strategy rooted in domestic reform and international coalition-building. Using macroeconomic indicators and sectoral data, the analysis highlights how India leveraged Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), and Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) to mitigate external shocks and attract investment realignment. The study focuses on four key sectors-electronics, pharmaceuticals, EVs, and semiconductors-and evaluates India's integration into frameworks such as the QUAD, IMEC, I2U2, and BRICS+. Notably, India's FDI inflows reached $83.5 billion in 2024, and forex reserves rose to a record $698.95 billion by mid-2025. The paper concludes that India is emerging as a credible rule-shaper in global trade, with lessons for resilience in a multipolar world.
