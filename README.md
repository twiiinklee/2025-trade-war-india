## 📌 Abstract

The 2025 US–China trade war marks a structural rupture in global trade. Unlike the tariff skirmishes of 2018, the renewed conflict involves tech decoupling, supply chain fragmentation, and bloc-driven economic realignment. This paper examines India’s shift from passive reaction to strategic assertiveness, using macro indicators and sectoral data to evaluate policy adaptation.

Focusing on semiconductors, electronics, EVs, and pharma, the paper assesses India’s use of PLI schemes, FTAs, and Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) to mitigate risk and absorb capital shifts. With FDI inflows hitting $83.5B and forex reserves peaking at $698.95B in 2025, India’s positioning within blocs like QUAD, BRICS+, IMEC, and I2U2 signals a transition from rule-taker to rule-shaper.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

This is not an academic thesis written under supervision — it’s a policy-oriented, data-driven paper authored independently without institutional backing. It reflects what’s possible when research is led by curiosity, executed with discipline, and shared to provoke thought beyond classrooms and conferences.
